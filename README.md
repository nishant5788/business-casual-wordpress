This is a Wordpress Project on which I am practicing in my free time. The main motive for this site is to showcase my skills as Wordpress Developer. I will upload this website to my own server and add the link to my portfolio. I don't have permission to openly add/give link of other wordpress sites I had created in past. So, this is just for that. 
It is just a simple vanilla wordpress site I am doing in my free time. I will slowly add some features on it.
