This is a demo project to showcase my WordPress Skills. I don't have permission to provide public portfolio of other sites I had created and some are closed too.

But as this is my own Demo Site, I can freely provide login details so that you can login and see admin panel and my work there. Currently, this project is ongoing and I have plan to add lot of things in it. It is just basic currently. I give 1-2 hours a day on it at max and this is why I chose this easy project because I wanted to put anything on my profile to show as quickly as possible.

Below are the features implemented on this website :-

1) Products - Pretty Basic currently. We can add Title, description and Images only. There is also a field down below where you can add related Blog Posts to the products. 
2) Team - You can team member with images, name, designation, description and social media links.
3) Store, About, Contact - Basic pages created using Siteorigin Page Builder.
4) Blog - Common Blog. In each post, you can add related products and those products will show up at bottom of each single post.


Plugins Used on this Website :-

1) Advanced Custom Field
2) Siteorigin Pagebuilder
3) Contact 7 Form
4) Crop Thumbnails


Pending Features which are to be added :-

1) Custom Search using WP REST API - This is on priority and will be added soon.
2) Products Gallery - There will be a option to add gallery for a particular product if it exists.
3) Team Member Improvement - There will be a popup which will display full description for each member. Currently, texts are scroll able. It will be a fixed small description and then popup link.
4) Adding Heart/Like Button on each Product page.
5) Woocommerce - That will be at the last. I don't have experience with Woocomerce. So, it will be first.
